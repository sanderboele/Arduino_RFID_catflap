This is my attempt at doing something useful with my otherwise
not so useful Staywell 500 catflap. I have two of these and I keep
repairing my installed flap with parts from the spare flap.

I grew tired of this, so I started working on a little Arduino project to hook up
the motor of the flap to a home made circuit and put an RFID antenna in the tunnel 
of the flap. My cat is wearing an RFID tag around it's neck to open the flap. It is 
robust and it never runs out of power.

The main parts consist of an 7805 regulator, an Arduino pro mini, an L293D motor controller
chip and Seeed studio's Electronic brick - 125Khz RFID Card Reader.
